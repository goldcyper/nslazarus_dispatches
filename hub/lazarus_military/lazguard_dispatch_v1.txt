[background-block=#DB7210][hr][size=140][b][color=DB7210]|[/color][color=white]⚔️ 1. What is the Lazarene Regional Guard?[/b][/color][/size][hr][/background-block]

[size=120]The Lazarene Regional Guard is the military force of Lazarus, tasked with protecting our region's interests. It is formed from two divisions: the Phalangites (officers) and Hoplites (trained recruits).[/size]

[b]Ranks of the Guard:[/b]
[list][*]Militia - a new recruit who has yet to participate in a training operation.
[*]Hoplite  - someone who has completed training and regularly participates in operations.
[*]Hypaspist  - an experienced updater with the Guard who has proven their commitment and skill during multiple update operations.
[*]Phalangite  - a new officer who knows how to trigger and lead operations.
[*]Epilektoi  - an experienced, veteran officer capable of organising operations and command-level decisions.
[*]Strategos - not an achievable rank but rather a political position, the  Minister for the Regional Guard is responsible for overseeing and leading the Guard in coordination with Lazarene regional interests.[/list]
 
[b]So what do I need to know about Nationstates?[/b]

A region has two officer positions: a founder and a World Assembly (WA) delegate. In most regions, only the founder has admin powers (“executive”), meaning they can kick people, change the appearance of the region, accept, reject or send embassy requests, and can also grant these authorities to others. In some regions, however, the WA delegate has these powers too:
[list][*]Either the founder has allowed the WA delegate to have those powers, or the founder “ceased to exist” because of inactivity or as punishment for rule breaking.
[*]The founder is the one who created the region, and can’t be removed, elected, replaced, or anything like it. He has absolute power. A WA delegate on the other hand is elected by other World Assembly nations. So in a region where the delegate has executive authority, you can “elect” your admin/leader.
[*]These votes (called “endorsements”) are counted every 12 hours, during an “update”. These take place, in Eastern Time (US East Coast), at 12 am, called “major update”, and 12 pm, called “minor update”. It is during these times that military operations are done, called raiding and defending.
[*]Being a neutral military, we take no side against either raiders or defenders. Instead, the Lazarene Regional Guard focuses on defending Lazarus, it’s interests and its allies. To keep in shape, we do occasional military operations against fascists and warzones.
[*]In case of an offensive military operation, we endorse each other in a late updating region and then move in seconds before our target updates. In case of a defensive military operation, we move in and endorse a native once there, or we endorse each other and hand it to a native afterwards.
[*]When to move is determined by a “trigger”, who calls the “GO” when you need to move in. The one we all endorse is called the “point” of an operation, also known as a “lead”. This is the person we want as our delegate.[/list]

 
[b]Keywords:[/b]
[list][*]Cease to Exist: when a nation is deleted, either because of inactivity or as punishment for rulebreaking.
[*]Delegate: the person in charge of World Assembly affairs of a region, and in some cases also an admin of the region.
[*]Defending: a defensive military operation to protect a region from hostile forces.
[*]Endorsements: a vote by a World Assembly nation for the delegacy. One can endorse multiple people.
[*]Executive: when the WA delegate has administrative powers, meaning they can change it’s appearance, kick people, etc.
[*]Jump point: a late updating region from where a military force moves.
[*]Major update: 12 am EST
[*]Minor update: 12 pm EST
[*]Point: the one all participants in an operation endorse to get that person into the delegacy.
[*]Raiding: invading a region in an offensive military operation.
[*]Trigger: the leader of an operation. They call when to shut up, what the estimated time is and when to move.
[*]Update: when the endorsements are counted and the delegate is determined. These are the times for military ops.[/list]

[img]https://media.tenor.com/BJZHOmTIJDMAAAAC/futurama-neutral.gif[/img]

[size=120]Lazarus is a neutral military meaning on an operational basis we are not solely defender or raider, as mentioned in the Charter: [url=https://nslazarus.com/forum/index.php?threads/2135/]Charter of the Lazarene Regional Guard[/url][/size]

[quote=Laz;48418487][b]Section 2. Establishment of Military Neutrality[/b]

(1) The regional military alignment of Lazarus will be neutral. Lazarus will bear the Neutral tag at all times.

(2) Lazarus may not bear any of the following tags: Defender, Imperialist, Independent, or Invader.[/quote]

[list][*]For large operations or beyond 10 WAs being contributed, the Delegate or First Citizen (PM) must approve the operation.[/list]
